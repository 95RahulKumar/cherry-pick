we know that if you want to move the branch we use following commands

1. commit
2. merge
3. rebase

on observation we can say that these commands are not used for moving the branch
branch will be mooves becouse of side effect of commit 
but we have reset command which will moove the branch

Reset has options 
--hard - mooves the  file both working area and staging area 
--mixed -  mooves the file only to stage area 
--soft - does not mooves the file 

so finally we can say that reset mooves the current branch 
from one commit to onather commit

git reset is used if you want to undow the changes
